15:29:10 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	So our fqdn is
15:29:25 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	device/name/alias
15:29:51 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	so for you it might not be necessary if you only have 1 device
15:30:48 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	so in Jive
15:30:54 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	this is our database structure
15:30:55 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	server
		instance
			class
				device/name/alias
15:31:16 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	exactly
15:31:30 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	1 instance for 1 talon board
15:31:42 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	so id is tagged on to the end of alias
15:31:50 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	alias-<id>
15:32:55 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	I mean I can just run the file with the config-db command
15:33:00 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	and see if it populates the database
15:33:28 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	yea
15:33:31 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	and 1 more thing
15:33:39 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	that <device> placeholder
15:33:48 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	is where the whole python script comes in
15:33:58 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	it converts the boardmap into a jason
15:34:07 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	because it tell it talon boards = 1,2,3
15:34:31 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	and it makes 3x of that json object each with talon-001, talon-002, talon-003
15:34:50 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	yea
15:34:56 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	but in your case you might not need a template because it's only 1 dish/1 board
15:35:18 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	yea
15:35:26 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	so the the midcbf_deployer script has 3 commands
15:35:42 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	generate-talondx-config, download-artifacts, and config-db
15:35:47 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	you don't need the first one
15:36:00 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	and can just assume you have a static json for #2, #3
15:36:06 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	Cool
15:36:29 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	Alright I have another meeting
15:36:30 From Aditya Joshi To Everyone:
	Cya
